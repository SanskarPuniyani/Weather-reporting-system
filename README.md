In this project a NodeMCU(ESP8266) was used to measure the temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and the result was displayed on a Blynk IoT dashboard.
The project was also programmed to send email alerts when specific threshold were exceeded.
Main Arduino sketch to run the project: 'weather.ino'
Wiring and connection file: 'Wiring.txt'
Required libraries: 'ESP8266WiFi.h', 'BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h', 'DHT.h'
